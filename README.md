Ever wanted a homescreen with no widget?

Google Now launcher users cannot have this privilige unless they have a single homescreen. With this app users (and other themes) can have multiple no-widget homescreens.

Simply add the widget to your homescreen and resize (optional). Being transparent you can view your beautiful wallpaper without any widget coming in your way.
